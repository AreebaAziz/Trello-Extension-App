									<h3>Areeba Aziz</h3>
									<p>Hello!! I'm in third year at McMaster, doing computer engineering. I know Java, C, PHP, python, JavaScript, SQL, Arduino and hobby electronics. I worked in backend software dev this summer. Uhhhhh idk what else, I like working with hardware and microcontroller programming, and backend systems. From htn I want to just have a great time learning new things, checking out the workshops and meeting new people! </p>

									<h3>Michelle Cheng</h3>
									<p>Hi, I'm Michelle Cheng. I'm a sophomore at Colby College, majoring in computer science. I was originally looking into engineering, but then got hooked by the CS department. I've learned Java and Python. I know my way around HTML and some javascript, and my most recent non-class project was a visualization and analysis tool coded in R for researchers that have the functions for PCA, Kmeans clustering, linear regression, shotgun regression, among other things. My goal at this hackathon is to learn a lot of new stuff, work on an interesting project, get to know you all, and hopefully score an internship. </p>

									<h3>Karthik Prasad</h3>
									<p>I'm Karthik Prasad, I'm in 1st year of MGMT Engineering at University of Waterloo. I did a lot of research related stuff related to graphene and thermovoltaics when i was into science but past few years have been venturing into engineering and my most recent project was bout image processing using MATLAB. I know Java, Python, HTML, CSS and a bit of C++. I also attend a lot of entrepreneurship and business conferences and am interested in the business aspect too. My two goals for HTN would be performing well with this team and learning a lot of new stuff!

									<h3>Rebecca Ma</h3>
									<p>Hi guys! I’m rebecca and I’m in year 1 computer science at Waterloo. I’ve done some programming before in python and java and I know a little bit of arduino. I guess my biggest goal from HTN would be to learn new things, attending workshops, and try out some new technology! </p>
